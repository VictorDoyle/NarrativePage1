# Narrative Page Project
---
## Introduction
This project is a simple approach to creating an on-browser narrative with background music in pure html and css with the addition of javascript Jquery. The project aims to explore how minimal visuals can heighten the experience of listening to music and how browsers can effectively be used to create a narrative for musical experiences.

## User Experience Outline
1. User is presented a minimal dark page with introductory writing.
2. User chooses to begin the narrative experience. If the user has already experienced it, the user can choose to begin the narrative experience from a specific "chapter".
3. Each chapter contains a different visual experience accompanied by a completely different musical experience.

The overall experience is to accompany the sounds of musical tones to minimal visuals, to heighten the user's experience of each musical composition.
